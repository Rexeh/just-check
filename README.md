# Just Check

We all like take-aways, and they're even better when they're delivered to our door. But not all take-aways are equal, 
and some may have quite shocking standards of hygiene.

This plug in hopes to make picking the ideal take-away even easier by displaying the result of the food safety inspection score
against each take-away on [just-eat.co.uk](http://www.just-eat.co.uk), making choosing what take-away to use even easier. I mean, you're not going to choose 
a 4 over a 0 are you?

## Installing

Just visit the plugin on the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/just-check/gmjbhhnhbfdnkpgjedfopcljmmccakag) and install!

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, and even encouraged. I'd like to get this to support more online take-away delivery sites, so would
be great if you could contribute!
