# Just Check

We all like take-aways, and they're even better when they're delivered to our door. But not all take-aways are equal, 
and some may have quite shocking standards of hygiene.

This plug in hopes to make picking the ideal take-away even easier by displaying the result of the food safety inspection score
against each take-away on [just-eat.co.uk](http://www.just-eat.co.uk), making choosing what take-away to use even easier. I mean, you're not going to choose 
a 4 over a 0 are you?

## Installing

This will probably go in the Chrome web store at some point, but for now, you can just [download the .crx file](https://github.com/pezholio/just-check/blob/master/just-check.crx?raw=true) and add it to 
Chrome.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, and even encouraged. I'd like to get this to support more online take-away delivery sites, so would
be great if you could contribute!
